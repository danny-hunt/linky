# Cursor Agent Rules for Linky Extension

## CRITICAL: Always Reference the PRD

**Before making any code changes or architectural decisions, you MUST read and follow the Product Requirements Document (PRD.md).**

The PRD.md file contains:
- All design decisions and product requirements
- Technical constraints and limitations
- Core functionality specifications
- User preference requirements
- Implementation guidelines

### Rules for Agents:

1. **Always read PRD.md first** - Before implementing any feature, read the entire PRD to understand the requirements
2. **Follow PRD specifications exactly** - The PRD defines what should be built, not the current codebase state
3. **Respect technical constraints** - The PRD specifies important constraints (no LinkedIn API, DOM parsing only, etc.)
4. **Use PRD as source of truth** - If code doesn't match PRD, update code to match PRD, not vice versa
5. **Reference PRD in code comments** - When implementing features, add comments referencing relevant PRD sections

### Current State:

The codebase is currently in early development. The PRD describes the target state. When implementing features:
- Follow the PRD specifications, not the current placeholder code
- The PRD describes "Linky" - a LinkedIn message draft generation extension
- Current code may be placeholder/example code that needs to be replaced

### Key PRD Requirements to Remember:

- No LinkedIn API calls - all data via DOM parsing
- Desktop Chrome extension only (Manifest V3)
- 1-on-1 chats only (not group chats)
- Drafts are inserted but NOT auto-sent
- Uses OpenAI API for message generation
- User preferences stored in Chrome extension storage
- Multiple interaction categories supported
